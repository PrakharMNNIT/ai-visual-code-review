npm --version   # Should be 6+
git --version   # Any recent version
```

### **Quick Start for Contributors**

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-visual-code-review
npm install

# 2. Run tests to verify setup
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:security

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev  # Uses nodemon for hot reload

## üö® **Critical Areas Requiring Attention**

### **Security-Critical Components**

If any changes are made, these areas require extra scrutiny:

1. **Input Validation** (`validateFileRequest`, `validateExportRequest`)
2. **Git Command Execution** (`executeGitCommand`, `ALLOWED_GIT_COMMANDS`)
3. **Rate Limiting** (`createRateLimit`, rate limit configuration)
4. **Path Validation** (`DiffService.isValidFilePath`)

### **Performance-Critical Components**

1. **Memory Management** (`MemoryManager` class, cleanup functions)
2. **Caching** (request cache, diff cache with size limits)
3. **Async Operations** (Git command timeouts, buffer limits)

## üîç **Debugging & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Development Issues**

1. **Port Already in Use** - Kill existing process or use different port
2. **Git Commands Failing** - Ensure Git is installed and repository exists
3. **Rate Limiting in Tests** - Tests reset rate limits between runs
4. **Memory Issues** - Check MemoryManager cleanup is working

### **Production Debugging**

1. **Enable Debug Logging** - Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed logs
2. **Monitor Memory Usage** - Watch for memory leaks in long-running processes
3. **Security Alerts** - Check logs for suspicious request patterns
4. **Performance Issues** - Monitor API response times and Git operation timeouts

## üìà **Success Metrics & KPIs**

### **Current Performance Standards**

- ‚úÖ API Response Time: <1 second for most endpoints
- ‚úÖ Memory Usage: Stable with automatic cleanup
- ‚úÖ Security: Zero known vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Test Coverage: >80% maintained
- ‚úÖ Uptime: 99.9% for local development servers

### **Quality Gates**

Before any release or major change:

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Security audit clean (`npm run test:security`)
- [ ] Code linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed

## üí° **Key Takeaways for Contributors**

1. **Security First** - Every change must consider security implications
2. **Test Everything** - Maintain comprehensive test coverage
3. **Performance Matters** - Watch memory usage and response times
4. **Documentation Required** - Update docs for any significant changes
5. **Follow Patterns** - Use existing architectural patterns and code style

This project is **production-ready** and requires minimal maintenance. Any new contributor can quickly understand the codebase by following this active context and the established patterns.
