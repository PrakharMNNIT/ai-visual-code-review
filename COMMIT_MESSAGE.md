ðŸ”§ feat(system): initialize memory-bank and fix CLI issues

## Problem

The project lacked comprehensive context preservation system and had CLI usability issues that required npx usage and produced excessive logging output.

## Solution

- Created comprehensive memory-bank system with 5 documentation files
- Fixed CLI argument parsing to work without npx
- Reduced excessive logging in development mode
- Corrected package.json binary paths
- Added VSCode Git service integration
- Established .clinerules development guidelines

## Impact

### Memory Bank System

- Complete project context preservation for contributors
- Comprehensive documentation covering architecture, technology stack, patterns
- Security-first development guidelines and best practices
- Implementation status tracking showing 100% completion
- Clear contributor guidance and setup instructions

### CLI & UX Improvements

- Resolves reported CLI execution issues (no more npx required)
- Cleaner development output (reduced logging spam)
- Better argument parsing and command recognition
- Improved package distribution and installation

### Security & Quality

- Maintains enterprise-grade security standards
- Documents security patterns and critical components
- Establishes consistent development workflow
- Provides comprehensive testing guidelines
