## Known Non-Issues

### "fatal: path 'COMMIT_MESSAGE.md' does not exist"

### Next Steps

1. **Manual Web Interface Testing** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   ./bin/ai-review.js web
   # Then open http://localhost:3000 and test
   ```

2. **Once Web Testing Passes:**
   - Update version in package.json (suggest 1.4.0)
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with fixes and improvements
   - Commit all changes
   - Run `npm publish`
   - Tweet launch announcement

3. **Post-Deployment:**
   - Monitor npm downloads
   - Watch for user issues
   - Update documentation based on feedback
