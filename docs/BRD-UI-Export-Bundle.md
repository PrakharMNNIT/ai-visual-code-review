# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Standalone HTML Bundle Export for Human Code Review

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Project:** AI Visual Code Review - UI Export Feature
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

Enable users to export code review results as a fully self-contained, interactive HTML/JS/CSS bundle that can be shared with other developers for collaborative human review without requiring server infrastructure.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

- **Collaboration Enhancement**: Enable asynchronous code review collaboration between team members
- **Offline Capability**: Allow code reviews to be conducted without internet connectivity
- **Distribution Simplicity**: Provide single-file distribution for easy sharing via email, Slack, or other channels
- **Accessibility**: Make code reviews accessible to stakeholders without technical setup requirements

### 1.3 Success Criteria

- Bundle size < 5MB for typical code reviews
- Load time < 3 seconds on standard hardware
- 100% feature parity with web interface for viewing and commenting
- Comments can be exported back to structured format (JSON/Markdown)
- Works across all modern browsers without plugins

---

## 2. Stakeholders

### 2.1 Primary Stakeholders

- **Development Teams**: Main users performing code reviews
- **Project Managers**: Reviewing code changes for sprint planning
- **Technical Leads**: Conducting architectural reviews
- **Open Source Contributors**: Reviewing pull requests offline

### 2.2 Secondary Stakeholders

- **QA Teams**: Reviewing code changes related to bugs
- **Documentation Teams**: Understanding code changes for docs
- **Security Teams**: Conducting security audits

---

## 3. Current State Analysis

### 3.1 Current Capabilities

- Web-based interface requires running local server (port 3002)
- Export to AI_REVIEW.md for AI analysis
- Line-by-line commenting with templates
- GitHub-like dark theme interface
- File selection and diff viewing

### 3.2 Current Limitations

- **Server Dependency**: Requires Node.js server to be running
- **No Sharing**: Cannot easily share review interface with others
- **No Collaboration**: Comments are local only, not shareable
- **Internet Required**: Git operations require connectivity
- **Setup Overhead**: Recipients need to clone repo and run server

### 3.3 Gap Analysis

| Current State              | Desired State                       | Gap                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Server-dependent interface | Self-contained HTML                 | Need bundler             |
| Local-only comments        | Shareable comments                  | Need export mechanism    |
| Live Git integration       | Snapshot of changes                 | Need data embedding      |
| No comment export          | Comment export to structured format | Need export feature      |
| Single user                | Multi-reviewer support              | Need comment attribution |
